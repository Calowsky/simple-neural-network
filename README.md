Neural Network Caleb Pekowsky 5/5/21

This is my ANN class. It has 4 input neurons, 4 hidden neurons, and 3 output neurons.
I chose 4 input neurons and hidden neurons to represent the 4 possible inputs.
I chose 3 output Neurons to represent the 3 types of iris flowers.

It works quite well, however I had to copy some code from the internet to do some of the linear algebra. I made comments where I had to do that.

To run this, run python3 Neural.py.
The data should be in the directory. if not, download the data, and maybe change it's name on line 195.
